## Potential Ideas
* An AI model that can teach itself to play an arcade video game (such as pacman)
* VR implementation with an AI model that tracks eye movement to enhance quality of life (example: squinting your eyes will zoom in on what you are looking at)
* An AI model that can take a photo of written notes and diagrams and digitalize them
